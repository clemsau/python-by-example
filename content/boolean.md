## Boolean in Python

The boolean represents the truth values `True` and `False`. They are used to evaluate conditions in control structures such as `if` statements and loops.

```python
is_true = True
is_false = False
```

Logical operations can be performed on boolean values in Python, such as `and`, `or`, and `not`:

```python
# AND
result = True and False
print(result) # Output: False

# OR
result = True or False
print(result) # Output: True

# NOT
result = not True
print(result) # Output: False
```
