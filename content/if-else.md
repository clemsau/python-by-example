## If Else in Python

The `if` keyword is used to create a conditional statement that executes a block of code if a condition is true.

```python
x = 5
if x > 3:
    print("x is greater than 3")
```

The `else` keyword can be used to execute a block of code if the condition is false.

```python
x = 2
if x > 3:
    print("x is greater than 3")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 3")
```

The `elif` keyword can be used to create multiple conditions in a single `if` statement.

```python
x = 3
if x > 3:
    print("x is greater than 3")
elif x < 3:
    print("x is less than 3")
else:
    print("x is equal to 3")
```
